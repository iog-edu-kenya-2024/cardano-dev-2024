## Course Description

This is a full-time course that will take you from zero to a productive Haskell and Smart Contract developer. In this course, we'll learn Haskell (an advanced, purely functional programming language), Marlowe (an ecosystem of tools and languages to enable the development of financial and transactional smart contracts), and Plutus (the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain).

Here's a high-level overview of each week's contents:

**⚠️ IMPORTANT!: The schedule and outline might be heavily modified according to student's interests and performance**

- **Week 1 (Haskell):** Introduction to Haskell's syntax, core principles, and IO.
- **Week 2 (Haskell):** Testing, common abstractions, tools, and testing.
- **Catchup week:**     Rest, catch up and consolidate the fundamental knowledge.
- **Week 3 (Haskell):** More abstractions, writing non-trivial programs, and data structures.
- **Week 4 (Haskell):** Combining effects, concurrency and parallelism, and Networking.
- **Week 5 (Marlowe):** Write smart contracts with Marlowe.
- **Week 6 (Plutus):** Cardano Blockchain, EUTxO, Plutus tooling and simple Plutus contracts.
- **Week 7 (Plutus):** Non-trivial Plutus smart contracts and complete Dapps.
- **Week 8 (Plutus):** Final project (chosen by the students) or More Dapps.

## Getting the Software

To go through this course, you will need:

### Haskell:
- `ghc` (the Haskell compiler) version `9.6.3`.
- `cabal-install` and Cabal library (a build tool for Haskell) version `3.10.2.0`.
- Haskell's Language Server
- A suitable text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, (Neo)Vim, Emacs) with proper configuration.

**If you want to start working on your own code**, we recommend using [this template](https://github.com/iog-edu-kenya-2024/haskell-template) which comes with a development environment ready to go.

**If you want to run the examples in this repo, choose the one you prefer:**
- Remote development environment: [Install the GitPod extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension), and click the new "Gitpod" button at the top of the repo.
- Local development environment inside Docker: Make sure you have the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. Open the `examples-haskell` folder in VSCode (not the root of the repo). You'll get a notification about a Dev Container config file. Click on "Reopen in Container".
- Local development environment directly on your computer using GHCup: Follow [these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSN5mxITv0A&list=PLNEK_Ejlx3x1D9Vq5kqeC3ZDEP7in4dqb&index=13) (all platforms).

### Marlowe
A local Docker instance or online environment provided by the instructors.
